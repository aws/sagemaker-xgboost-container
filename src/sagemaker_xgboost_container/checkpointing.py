    """Create a callback that saves checkpoints to disk.

    The main purpose of this class is to support checkpointing for managed spot
    training:
    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-managed-spot-training.html.
    Since spot instances can be interrupted at anytime, we need to be able to
    save checkpoints during training, and we also need to be able to resume
    from the last checkpoint when the training job is restarted.

    We save each checkpoint to different files at the end of each iteration by
    appending the iteration number to the file name, e.g., xgboost-checkpont.1,
    xgboost-checkpont.2, and so on. These files are written to `checkpoint_dir`,

    Since saving one checkpoint per iteration could result in a large number of
    files to save in S3 and download when spot instances are resumed, we retain
    only the `max_to_keep` (5 by default) most recent checkpoints in the
    directory. This is accomplished by a background thread that deletes all
    checkpoints older than 5 most recent checkpoints (the number of files to
    keep is somewhat arbitrary, choosing the optimal number of files to keep is
    left for future work). Note that when a file is being uploaded by SM, it
    will create a marker file (file name + .sagemaker-uploading) to indicate
    that the file is being uploaded. SM will also create another marker file
    (file name + .sagemaker-uploaded) when the upload is completed. Thus, the
    background will skip deleting a file and try again later if there is a
    marker file <filename>.sagemaker-uploading and only attempt to delete a
    file when the marker file <filename>.sagemaker-uploaded is present.

    Attributes:
        checkpoint_dir: indicates the path to the directory where checkpoints
            will be saved.  Defaults to /opt/ml/checkpoints on SageMaker.
        max_to_keep: indicates the maximum number of recent checkpoint files to
            keep.  As new files are created, older files are deleted.  Defaults
            to 5 (that is, the 5 most recent checkpoint files are kept.)
        start_iteration: indicates the round at which the current training
            started. If xgb_model was loaded from a previous checkpoint, this
            will be greater than 0 (that is, if the previous training ended
            after round 19, start_iteration will be 20).
        num_round: (optional) indicates the number of boosting rounds.

        >>> save_checkpoint = SaveCheckpoint("/opt/ml/checkpoints")
        >>> xgboost.train(prams, dtrain, callbacks=[save_checkpoint])
